9-16. Python Module of the Week: One excellent resource for exploring the
Python standard library is a site called Python Module of the Week. Go to
https://pymotw.com/ and look at the table of contents.

Find a module that
looks interesting to you and read about it, perhaps starting with the random
module.


Styling Classes
A few styling issues related to classes are worth clarifying, especially as your
programs become more complicated.


Class names should be written in CamelCase. To do this, capitalize the
first letter of each word in the name, and donâ€™t use underscores. Instance
and module names should be written in lowercase with underscores between
words.
